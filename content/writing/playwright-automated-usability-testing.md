<p><strong>You can simulate realistic user behavior with personas and Playwright to catch obvious UX issues before recruiting real participants.</strong> This doesn’t replace moderated studies, but it’s great for fast feedback and regression‑testing known behaviors.</p>

<section>
<h2>What We’ll Use</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Playwright</strong> via an MCP‑compatible AI client (e.g., Claude Desktop + Playwright MCP)</li>
<li>A small demo repo with personas and a testing framework: <a href="https://github.com/storbeck/user_persona_tests" rel="external">github.com/storbeck/user_persona_tests</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The repo includes <code>CLAUDE.md</code> (system instructions) and <code>personas/</code> (ready prompts). Running a session will generate <code>report.md</code> and screenshots locally.</p>
</section>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Install the Playwright MCP server:
            
```
claude mcp add playwright npx '@playwright/mcp@latest'
```

</li>
<li>
Clone the example repo:
            
```
git clone https://github.com/storbeck/user_persona_tests
cd user_persona_tests
```

</li>
<li>Open your MCP client and ensure Chromium is available to Playwright.<br><em>Tip:</em> Install the browser binaries with:<br>
```
npx playwright install chromium
```
</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Run a Persona Session</h2>
<ol>
<li>Load <code>CLAUDE.md</code> as the system instruction.</li>
<li>Pick a persona in <code>personas/</code> (e.g., Efficient Shopper) and paste it as the user prompt.</li>
<li>Start the run. The agent will:
<ul>
<li>Launch a browser with tracing/video (as supported)</li>
<li>Follow the persona’s behavior and mission (we sign up first with demo data)</li>
<li>Capture screenshots of key steps</li>
<li>Generate a Markdown UX report (<code>report.md</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> The included demo personas target a clothing site built for automation practice. </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Customize for Your Product</h2>
<p>Duplicate a file in <code>personas/</code> and tweak:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mindset &amp; behavior</strong> (search‑first vs. browse‑first, cautious vs. fast)</li>
<li><strong>Mission</strong> (what to accomplish and how to judge success)</li>
<li><strong>Device</strong> (mobile viewport or desktop)</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep instructions concise and literal; the agent follows them exactly.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Interpreting Outputs</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>report.md</code> — Step log, observations, pain points, strengths, and recommendations</li>
<li><code>.playwright-mcp/</code> — Screenshots/traces to attach to tickets or PRs</li>
</ul>
<p>Use these artifacts to gate UI changes with a quick “persona pass,” compare behavior before/after design tweaks, and share reproducible UX issues with designers and engineers.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Where This Helps (and Where It Doesn’t)</h2>
<p><strong>Great for:</strong> early discovery of obvious issues, consistent regression checks, and exercising flows under different mindsets.</p>
<p><strong>Not a replacement for:</strong> moderated tests, accessibility audits, or research with representative users. Treat this as a fast feedback layer before deeper studies.</p>
